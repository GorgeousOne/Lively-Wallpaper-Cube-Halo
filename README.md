# Wallpaper Engine Theme "Cube Halos"

This project is an animated interactive desktop wallpaper that I use with [Lively Wallpaper](https://www.rocksdanister.com/lively/).
It works like a static website and uses [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering.  
(There should definetely be a way to use this in Wallpaper Engine)
